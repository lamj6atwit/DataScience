# DataScience
  In this project, I am going to perform an analysis of shopping trends from the Kraggle website under the author Sourav Banerjee. I decided to choose shopping trends because it seemed like an interesting topic as everyone in the world wears and purchases clothes. This gives a variety of different data points and plenty of variation to choose from as everyone likes and dislikes certain styles. With 19 columns and over 3,000 samples, this data set provides great information for generating questions to answer. Since the source of the data was not taken from any other site and was instead generated by ChatGPT to simulate a realistic customer shopping experience, this means that the data might lack the authenticity of real-world scenarios. However, given these warnings beforehand, the data generated would be great for educational purposes and can be a great way to learn about data science using a set of data that can be easy to analyze and work with.

Questions: 
Depending on the season can we determine when coats would be bought the most?

Does the age of the customer influence how much money they would be willing to spend on a single shopping trip?

Did certain payment methods fluctuate during the season?
